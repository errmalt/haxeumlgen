HaxeUmlGen generates class diagrams dynamically for a haXe project.
HaxeUmlGen can run in two modes.  It can draw diagram images, or it
can generate XMI projects which can be imported into UML tools.  To
generate images, graphviz must be installed and the binary must be
added to the path.  Graphviz is a free program that can be found at
http://www.graphviz.org.


USAGE

HaxeUmlGen uses the xml file created when the -xml flag is passed in
to the haxe compiler.  It can be run directly from haxelib.

  haxelib run HaxeUmlGen MODE XMLFILE

where
  MODE is "dot" to generate images or "xmi" to generate an xmi project
  XMLFILE is the file that the haxe compiler created

For example, to generate diagram images of myproject, compile with

  haxe -neko myproject.n -xml myproject.xml MyProject.hx

then generate diagrams with

  haxelib run haxeumlgen dot myproject.xml

That will create a files called [packagename].png for each package in
the same directory as myproject.xml

An XMI project can be generated with

  haxelib run haxeumlgen xmi myproject.xml

That will create a file called myproject-xmi.xml in the same directory
as myproject.xml

The output directory can be changed with the --outdir command line
parameter.  Foreground and background colors for the images can be
changed with -f COLOR and -b COLOR, respectively.  COLOR should be a
six character hex code, like color specifications for html.  Don't
quote colors or prefix with a sharp (#).  All command line options can
be listed with

  neko haxeumlgen --help

CHXDOC

ChxDoc is a source documentation tool written by Russell Weir.
HaxeUmlGen can be integrated with chxdoc by following the instructions
found in the chxdoc directory.
